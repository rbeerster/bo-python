The Debian Package python-blitzortung
----------------------------

The following software has to be installed manually, as it is not available through debian/ubuntu packages at the moment:

Requires numpy >= 1.7 and pandas >= 0.9 to have a finally usable 64 bit timestamp support.

Requires injector.
